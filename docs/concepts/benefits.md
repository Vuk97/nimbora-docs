### A Gasless experience
    
You're eager to deposit funds into a L1 DeFi protocol to earn yields or borrow assets, but have you considered the potential cost in gas fees? Could it be $20, $100, or a staggering $300? The same applies for withdrawals or repayments.

| Action            | Gas used       | Gas Price (Eth) - 40 Gwei  | Gas Price (USD) - 3k eth/usd  |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Deposit / Redeem | 700K - 1M6     | 0.030589257 - 0.058813266     | $91.767771 - $176.439798 |
| Borrow / Repay   | 580K - 900K    | 0.025470271 - 0.039561244     | $76.410813 - $118.683732 |


Given the prevalent gas prices averaging around 40 Gwei, it's evident that gas fees pose a significant challenge for portfolios of low to medium value. For instance, a $100 gas cost could equate to 1% of a $10,000 portfolio, a substantial proportion that can impact overall returns. This issue is further compounded when adjustments or rebalancing of positions are required.

At Nimbora, our primary objective is to foster inclusivity within the realm of DeFi. We firmly believe that individuals should have the opportunity to earn yields, regardless of whether they're investing $50 or $5,000. Financial constraints should never be a barrier to entry.

Our innovative solution involves batching user transactions, allowing for efficient execution and minimal gas expenditure [More details here](/docs/concepts/cost_efficiency). 
By leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, we're breaking down barriers and democratizing access to DeFi opportunities for all.


### Expanding DeFi Access from Layer 2

While Layer 2 (L2) solutions represent a significant innovation for scaling Ethereum DeFi, the majority of the ecosystem and liquidity remains rooted in Layer 1 (L1). It's important to acknowledge that L2 can take several years to mature into a resilient and robust DeFi ecosystem with deep liquidity. This challenge is further exacerbated when the L2 solution is not EVM-compatible, as protocols must allocate significant resources to deploy on these new platforms.

Moreover, even in cases where protocols successfully deploy on L2, they encounter a fundamental difference in market dynamics compared to L1. For instance, consider Aave pools on Ethereum and Polygon. Despite being the same protocol, each pool operates within distinct L1 and L2 markets, each with its unique characteristics and nuances.

Nimbora introduces a pioneering advancement by bridging the gap for emerging Layer 2 (L2) solutions, granting access to a plethora of Ethereum DeFi protocols (Current integrations). In essence, even nascent L2 platforms devoid of native DeFi infrastructure can now rival Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem with Nimbora's support.

We empower these burgeoning chains, rendering them viable during their transitional phase. Furthermore, our intervention catalyzes the emergence of distinct markets as these platforms mature, thus broadening the DeFi landscape and fostering innovation
